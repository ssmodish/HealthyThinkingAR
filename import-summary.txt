ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Risky Project Location:
-----------------------
The tools *should* handle project locations in any directory. However,
due to bugs, placing projects in directories containing spaces in the
path, or characters like ", ' and &, have had issues. We're working to
eliminate these bugs, but to save yourself headaches you may want to
move your project to a location where this is not a problem.

                               -   -      -    -                         

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* assets\ => app\src\main\assets\
* libs\armeabi-v7a\libmain.so => app\src\main\jniLibs\armeabi-v7a\libmain.so
* libs\armeabi-v7a\libmono.so => app\src\main\jniLibs\armeabi-v7a\libmono.so
* libs\armeabi-v7a\libunity.so => app\src\main\jniLibs\armeabi-v7a\libunity.so
* libs\armeabi-v7a\libVuforia.so => app\src\main\jniLibs\armeabi-v7a\libVuforia.so
* libs\armeabi-v7a\libVuforiaUnityPlayer.so => app\src\main\jniLibs\armeabi-v7a\libVuforiaUnityPlayer.so
* libs\armeabi-v7a\libVuforiaWrapper.so => app\src\main\jniLibs\armeabi-v7a\libVuforiaWrapper.so
* libs\unity-classes.jar => app\libs\unity-classes.jar
* libs\Vuforia.jar => app\libs\Vuforia.jar
* libs\VuforiaUnityPlayer.jar => app\libs\VuforiaUnityPlayer.jar
* res\ => app\src\main\res\
* src\ => app\src\main\java\

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
